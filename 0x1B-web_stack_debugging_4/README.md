# Web Stack Debugging 4

## Overview

In this web stack debugging task, the goal is to enhance the performance of a web server setup featuring Nginx. The issue at hand is a high number of failed requests when subjected to a benchmark using ApacheBench. The task involves identifying and resolving the root cause of the problem to achieve zero failed requests.

## Problem Analysis

Upon benchmarking with ApacheBench, the initial results showed a significant number of failed requests. The server is running Nginx/1.4.6, and the failed requests are impacting the overall performance of the web server.

### Initial Benchmark Results

```bash
Failed requests: 943
```

## Solution

A Puppet manifest (`0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp`) was created to address the identified issues and improve the web server's performance. The manifest was applied using the following command:

```bash
puppet apply 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp
```

### Updated Benchmark Results

After applying the Puppet manifest, a subsequent benchmark with ApacheBench showed improved results:

```bash
Failed requests: 0
```

The web server now handles the specified load without any failed requests, demonstrating the successful resolution of the performance issue.
